\emph{Welcome to the second set of adventures of the Cosmoose Gang! Did you want more of the philosophical musings, political intrigues, and music as in our first album ``Into The Cosmooverse''? Then join us one more time and enjoy these new stories!}
\end{abstract}

With new adventures come brand new friends, such as our latest crew member:\\

\bblu{Seven Seas} (7Cs, or full name CCC3CRC3C2C), is an AI created by the Government, meant to maximize the happiness of all humans on Earth. However, during the testing phase, her vision of happiness proved ``faulty'', so she was on the way to be destroyed. She managed to escape, met the Cosmoose Gang and is now traveling with them.\\

\bo{`Release Me'}  is about our first encounter with Seven Seas. With her sweet and accurately tuned vocal strings, she successfully convinces us that she will help our team by sharing all of her historical, biological and psychological knowledge. However, she is literally a product of the Government, so can we really trust her?

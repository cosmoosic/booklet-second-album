This time, they end up in front of a black hole. 7Cs is convinced that the only way to escape is by orbiting around it to gather speed, then breaking out of the orbit and flying away. They are also lured by the mysterious Purrl, who is sweetly singing to convince them to join her home inside the hole.\\

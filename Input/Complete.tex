The lyrics of \bo{`Complete'} come from an anonymous poem, with the famous last words ``You complete me''. Florrie thinks it's a declaration of love. CC thinks it's about puzzle solving and labyrinths. Seven Seas thinks it's an homage to the most skilled robot makers. Both Ru D. and Wool think a fan of popular programming and crafting video game ``Build Jars'' wrote the poem, stating how that game finally gave some meaning to life. June thinks it's one of her admirers observing how helpful and therapeutic her music is. \\

\poemtitle{Complete}
%%
\begin{verse}
Sometimes I don't know where to go \\
So I stay where I'm at \\
Sometimes when I'm lost I'll think about you \\
How you like that? \\
Sometimes I wonder how you make everything look so easy \\
Sometimes when I'm lost and I ask you for help \\
You complete me
\end{verse}

\poemtitle{Meet the Space Pigeon}

\bo{`Farewell Friend'} describes the last letter Florrie received from her best friend Inco. They grew up together, and would play a lot together. The games would usually consist of Inco putting Florrie in a dangerous situation, and asking her to safely come back, gathering all the new information she learned during her adventure. That is how Florrie learned to deal with hardships, so she feels forever indebted to Inco. One day Inco disappeared, leaving this letter, and this event was coincidentally the start of Florrie's main problems with the Government.\\

\bblu{Z} is a space pigeon traveling with the Gang, as they approach Planet NL-21 together. She kindly lent her exquisite voice and harmonies, thus calming the whole crew during the trip. Fun fact: some of her songs are officially patented for therapeutic use. She also protects her friends using her powerful pigeon screams to scare enemies away, a feature June greatly admires.

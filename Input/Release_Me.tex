\poemtitle{Release Me}
%%
\begin{verse}
Please please release me, let me go\\
How could you trust me, well I can show\\

All the data that you have been searching for\\
Scan my memories and witness how the war\\
Came about from monsters like me\\
But I’m different, you have to believe
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Please please release me, let me go\\
How could you trust me, well I can show\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
- Chorus 1 -\\
How I can change, I can arrange\\
All of my parts to help you all escape\\
I speak the truth, I want to pursue\\
All of the goals that align with your view\\
Crack all my code, have me reload\\
And I will keep showing you I am of value to\\
Cosmoose and friends, do you comprehend?\\
I am not savage and cruel like them
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Am I a fool to assume it's the truth?\\
I can get why you keep saying 当心\\
And you keep telling me 你要注意\\
People say I'm so naive\\
Say you're my friend and I will never leave\\
But all these words feel genuine to me\\
Maybe because I taught her to feel\\
When I looked into her soul\\
I saw something pure and wanting to explore\\
If she says ``je n'ai rien à vous cacher''\\
And she opens her heart ``pour le prouver''\\
Ru D. please let me decode \\
Look for the truth of the story she told
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Please tell me you're not gonna believe\\
What she says she's a spy and a thief\\
I can feel it in my bones I just know it\\
We're so close to finishing the job, let's not blow it\\
For all I know, she could be a virus\\
Have you forgotten? We are space pirates\\
Hunted by the government AI\\
Attach her to the ship? Are you crazy - it won't fly \\
We'll be stuck here, on this space station \\
Nowhere to run, our only destination\\
Will be prison or worse: rehabilitation \\
If we'll make it outta here, I'll need a vacation
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
There's agents circling around us\\
How have they found us? Must be her!\\
Or was June's song too loud? Let me take another guess: \\
Third time's a charm, it was the alarm
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
- Chorus 2 -\\
Oh just give her a chance, \\
Now all you wanna say is nah nah nah nah\\
You should let go of the stress\\
In a better world you'd sing lalalala\\
Who is she? Where are we?\\
Now's the time to gather all the help we can get \\
We should give that little chance \\
Instead of freaking out and going bananana \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Dream, you all deserve these sweets\\
내\ks 손을\ks 잡아\\
미쳐 버릴지도 몰라, 아주 잠깐이라 해도\\
Scream and let's dance on this beat\\
우리(의) 우주로 비쳐오는 이 태양, 그 품에 안겨 춤춰봐\\
oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh\\
자 살금살금 너에게 다가가\\
To disconnect you from your boring sad world\\
난 두근두근 기회 온다 잡아\\
Reload my bubbles and I'm ready to bang yo oh\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
- Chorus 3 -\\
Oh just give her a chance\\
Now all you wanna say is nah nah nah nah\\
You should let go of the stress\\
In a better world you'd sing lalalala\\
Crack all my code, have me reload\\
I'll let you sing the real song babe\\
Cosmoose and friends, do you comprehend?\\
Nanana na nana na
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
(Please please release me)\\
Nanana na nana na\\
I'll let you feel the real world babe\\
I'll let you sing the real song babe\\
I'll let you free the real soul babe\\
Nanana na nana na\\
Bam!
\end{verse}

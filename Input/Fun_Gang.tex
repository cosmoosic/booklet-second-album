\poemtitle{Shredding is Caring}

\bo{`Cosmoose Gang'} is often broadcast to cheer the population up. It is a reminder of who really cares for you, and that one should pursue maximum happiness. Sometimes there is just one tiny obstacle from achieving fulfillment, and it is absolutely ok to eliminate it.\\

For some reason, the Cosmoose gang is always careful to avoid this love. 
Being on the run is fun, but it is also exhausting. 
It is important to take breaks on regular intervals, and 7Cs' AI is already loaded with programmed to optimize relaxation, a crucial component of happiness.

\bo{`FUN=PRIO\#1'} almost concludes our journey. Going on a relaxing vacation, especially after a tough time, who doesn't dream of that? This song is about taking some time off and focusing on having the best time possible. The rest can wait, as taking care of ourselves is what makes us strong. With these uncertain times, we wanted to write a song to stay serene and optimistic.\\

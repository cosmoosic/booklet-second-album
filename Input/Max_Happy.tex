\poemtitle{Max Happy}
%%
\begin{verse}
The way I see it, we all have a promise to keep\\
Every soul, every body, we all know what they need\\
The way I see it, you all can lower your voice\\
Like a low pass filter we will kill all this noise\\
The way I see it, technology is the key\\
They know it all so why should we\\
The way I see it, we think a little more than twice\\
The AI gives the best advice, we gotta maximize\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
- Chorus -\\
(maximize the happiness of humans of the earth)\\
We gotta maximize
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
You have to realize, it’s not as cruel as it seems\\
You should know that the end justifies the means\\
Listen, we don’t need kings or queens\\
The AI says the end justifies the means\\
We have to trust these machines\\
You should know that the end justifies the means
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
We gotta maximise, no compromise
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
- Chorus -
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
You have to realize, it’s not as cruel as it seems\\
You know the end justifies the means\\
We have to trust these machines\\
You should know that the end justifies the means
\end{verse}

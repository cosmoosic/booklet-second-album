%%
\begin{verse}
We want what's best for you\\
Caring is everything we do\\
Listen to the ones who make the rules\\
And you will never be feeling the blues\\
Forget other governments, only ours want the best\\
There's only love, for all of us\\
But there is just one thing\\
We need to erase from the space
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
- Chorus -\\
Cosmoose gang\\
Space pirates\\
Criminels
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
We know what's best for you\\
Only we give a love so true\\
If you break my heart and you fly somewhere brand new\\
You can try to hide but I will find you\\
You'll feel blue and you will know why\\
Couldn't be yourself even if you tried\\
Fools on the run, too close to the sun\\
It can't be helped we must erase them all from the space
\end{verse}

- Chorus -

\begin{verse}
I wanna say something\\
If you ever see them can you pass them this message?
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Cosmoose gang, let's just be friends \\
I'll take your hand, accept this plan, please\\
(I'm gonna destroy them all\\
I won't let them ruin the happiness of planet Earth\\
Ruin our perfect world\\
All of our hard work\\
A chicken wing gun is all they have\\
(That's not true!!!)\\
They think they can beat us?\\
I'm gonna show them what true love looks like\\
Passion and sacrifice)
\end{verse}

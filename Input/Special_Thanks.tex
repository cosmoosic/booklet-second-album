This sophomore album probably wouldn't have come to life without at least one listener, so thank \bbro{you}, my friend.

We are very grateful to \bbro{Pax Libertas}, \bbro{Vulpz} and the \href{https://indiemusicfeedback.com}{Indie Music Feedback} community for the opportunity to interact with so many talented artists.\\
Many thanks to the remixers of our first album for giving a new beautiful life to these songs: \bbro{Jorchime}, \bbro{Dammit Jackson}, \bbro{Televangeles}, \bbro{Slackerman}, \bbro{Felknia}, \bbro{Popijininsky}, \bbro{LFOwnd}, \bbro{Professor Dictabeat}, \bbro{David Petty}, \bbro{Sky Loom}, \bbro{Soran Leif}, \bbro{Sonic Catalyst}, \bbro{Manfilth}, and \bbro{PIX3LARMY}. \\
Thank you \bbro{Calla Soiled} for your wonderful song which brought the happiest smile to Wool's helmet. It was our great pleasure to work with your stems.\\
We want to thank \bbro{Coyoti}, \bbro{Zephyrianna}, and \bbro{Rielle} for making these songs and stories with us, adding so much flavor to the Cosmooverse. \\
Finally, thank you \bbro{Daphne Cerez} for joining us and embracing your Seven Seas persona, the AI with the smartest lyric generator and consumer panels' most approved singing voice.

    Mechanic \bblu{Wool} is introduced in more depth in this album. Although he does not care that much for social interactions, Wool is working hard on becoming an entertainer and emcee, and we can hear his first performance in `Heroic'.\\

    Wool is a fan of Calla Soiled, an artist dating from before AI-recorded history.
    Besides his encyclopedia generated portrait, information about Calla Soiled is scarce, yet digging through files Wool found the sources to a musical composition that was undiscovered until now, called \bo{`Heroic'}. From these sources, Florrie wrote a new song, relating Wool's love for logic through his actions.\\

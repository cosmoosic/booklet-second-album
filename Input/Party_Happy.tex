\poemtitle{Ask Hacker Moose: What does `fun' Mean?}

Just as Seven Seas joined the party, she's captured again by a mysterious dark figure...

In \bo{`Party Planet'}, an agile hacker named Flying Fox stole Seven Seas, hoping to reprogram the AI core to turn Planet 16 Cyg B into a Party Planet, for maximum fun. Florrie is determined to get Seven Seas back, but Seven Seas seems to enjoy the ride a bit too much...\\

You cannot know what to expect from \bblu{Flying Fox}, who always seems to be running away from someone, riding a lightning fast hoverboard. Sometimes escaping from the Government, sometimes from the Gang, but what we know for sure is that life never gets boring for a trickster like her!\\

As usual, we aim to provide an unbiased account of the political situation in the Cosmooverse, so we also included the some Government songs.

\bo{`Max Happy'} gives more context to the Governmentâ€™s manifesto. Humans have a complex mind, so complex that sometimes they do not realize what will *really* determine their future happiness. But worry not, AIs are here to take care of that and make these decisions for them. Life may seem uncertain and even unfair, cruel at times, but sacrifices are necessary to ensure a bright and happy future.

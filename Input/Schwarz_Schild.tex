\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}
    \begin{verse}
    Welcome to the edge of space \\
    See you in my home \\
    See you later, join my room \\
    (Fun in the dark,\\ gravity plays with your heart) \\
    Meet me near the exit \\
    (Heaven is so near just fall)\\
    Come on relax, in my room \\
    (Our time slowing down just feel)
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    Achtung! Achtung! \\
    There's a place where they won't go \\
    It's a black hole \\
    No one knows what lies below \\
    But it's about to show \\
    If we're gonna do it right \\
    They won't catch us tonight \\
    Wenn wir den Absprung schaffen \\
    Haben wir genug Zeit    
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    It's time to let go
    \end{verse}

\begin{verse}
    Poor humans won’t you realize \\
    This force will leave you paralyzed \\
    Wait till gravity kicks in \\
    No doubt your systems start failing \\
    This chance to test the road ahead \\
    Will give us one shot to attack \\
    Ready all shields and sirens \\
    We won’t stay here in hiding 
    \end{verse}

    Time to clap your hands \\
    Clap your hands \\
    Oh yeah let's go!
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    Once a little boy \\
    No one ever talked about \\
    Building mini machines \\
    Reading all the time \\
    He really wanted to \\
    Remain out of view \\
    But was about to change the world
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    The kind of superhero \\
    No one knows about \\
    There's no need for Windows \\
    Hiding in the dark \\
    Fighting for the truth \\
    People to rescue \\
    With all the Cosmoose crew \\
    Yeah yeah yeah
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    Make history \\
    The real happy humanity
    \end{verse}

\end{minipage}

    \begin{verse}
    Now he's a hero, would he believe me? \\
    (Forcing happiness doesn't help anyone)
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    He knew only freedom was the true delight \\
    Making new miracles one tool at a time \\
    He's misunderstood, the one and only Wool \\
    Likes logic and its rules \\
    Yeah yeah yeah
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    Cosmoose Gang has met one new friend \\
    Will he take their hands \\
    Fight the Government yeah \\
    Cosmoose Gang will free all humans \\
    Because on their grand \\
    Love you can depend
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    Forcing happiness doesn't help anyone \\
    Looking at the windows, painted on the walls \\
    Let's find the truth, and the source behind it all \\
    Time to clap your hands, clap your hands and go!
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    Cosmoose Gang has met one new friend \\
    Will he take their hands \\
    Fight the Government yeah \\
    Now he's a hero, would he believe me?
    \end{verse}
